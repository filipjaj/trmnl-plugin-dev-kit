# TRMNL Plugin Development Kit

A plugin development kit for TRMNL devices.

Developing private plugins can be a difficult task where you're creating 4 different layouts.
Editing on the [TRMNL website](https://usetrmnl.com) is helpful, but I find it hard to work with the layout provided and to change the data you're using in the template.
This development kit allows you to view your four layouts easily and to provide various versions of the data used in the template without having to get the data onto TRMNL's servers.
